Description: A package that facilitates displaying RNA reactivity data on a RNA secondary structures when used with R2R drawing software. Includes (1) functions to read common RNA lab data formats into R (.ct and .react files), (2) A function that generates a currated list of palettes that look good on a RNA secondary structure, (3) a function that assigns colors based on experimental reactivity data, and (4) a function that writes a Stockholm file that goes directly into R2R to generate a secondary structure.
